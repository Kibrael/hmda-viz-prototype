# HMDA Viz Prototype

**This project is a prototype!**

## Description

Round 1 is to replicate, as is, the UI of [FFIEC](http://www.ffiec.gov/) reporting. The aggregate, disclosure, and national reports will all be included.

## Requirements

This **prototype** will be built on the gh-pages branch, so Jekyll is required.

## How to get this running or how to use it

Simply clone the repo, and with Jekyll installed locally, run `jekyll serve`.
